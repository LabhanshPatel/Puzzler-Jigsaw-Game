## Intro Video


## About
Puzzler is an open source jigsaw puzzle game built for the web using the Unity Engine. This is currently the Alpha version since it is missing a lot of features
I would like to add in the future.

### How-to-Play
Currently Puzzler is not hosted, but that will be changing. You can clone the repo down and open it using Unity if you want to create your own build to play. 

### Instructions
Once you have the game open, click "Start Game" on the title page. This will take you to the puzzle selection page. Click on the picture that you want to turn into a
puzzle and the picture will be cut into pieces and shuffle on the game board. Assemble the puzzle like any standard jigsaw puzzle by clicking you mouse on the pieces
and placing them in the correct slot. Pieces will lock in place once they are in the correct location. To start another game, refresh the page and choose a different 
puzzle to solve.
